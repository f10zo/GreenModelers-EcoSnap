# EcoSnap üì∏ - Sea of Galilee Pollution Reporter

## üåø About the Project

**EcoSnap** is a community-driven platform dedicated to monitoring and protecting the **Sea of Galilee (Kinneret)**.  
Our mission is to empower citizens to become active guardians of this vital natural resource by providing a simple and effective way to report pollution incidents. By leveraging technology, we aim to create a shared database of pollution reports that can be used by local authorities and environmental organizations to take informed and timely action.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Gallery:** Browse all reported incidents, filter by pollution level, and sort by date.

## üñº How It Works

The EcoSnap reporting process is designed to be simple and highly effective:

1.  **Users upload a photo of pollution.**
2.  **The app automatically detects the location** or allows for manual input.
3.  **YOLO and CircularNet models detect objects** like plastic bottles, cans, paper, and other trash.
4.  **An initial report description is auto-filled by the AI detection.** Users can then review and manually **edit this description** before submission.
5.  **All reports are displayed in an interactive gallery** for the community and authorities, creating a powerful visualization of the problem.
